  Developer Diary - A Gatsby Starter
</h1>

![devDiary](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/605o40f9b92e9m8/devdiary.jpg?dl=0)

_Developer Interview diary is a Gatsby Starter blog template created with web developers in mind, but really, anyone can use it. It's totally usable right out of the box, but minimalist enough to be easily modifiable to suit your needs. No matter how much you change it, though, you'll definitely want to make use of the tech tags and developer social media links, and maybe even make some of your own._<br>

## Features

- Ready to go - Blog author name, author image, etc,... can be easily added using a config file.
- Includes Netlify CMS. Users can log in to an admin page and easily create a blog post with a nice, simple user interface.
- Blog posts created as markdown files. It's easy to get started with markdown if you're unfamiliar - [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- Gatsby v.2
- React v.16.8.
- Mobile responsive
- Pagination
- Social media sharing icons in each post
- Icons from React Icons (Font Awesome, Devicons, etc,...)
- Beautiful tech-topic tags to attach to your web-development-related blog posts.
- Developer-relevant social media icon links, including GitHub, Stack Overflow, and freeCodeCamp.
- Minimalist design makes it highly modifiable; make your own customized contact forms and search components, for example.

## Getting Started

If you don't have Gatsby CLI installed yet, do that:

```

Navigate into your new project's directory:

```
cd your-blog-name
```

and run the development server:

Go to the [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see your new blog.<br>
Go to [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) to explore your site with a simple GraphQL interface.<br>
Go to the [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) to access the content management system. (Make sure you've set things up with Netlify CMS first - see "Adding blog posts using Netlify CMS (Content Management System)" below)
